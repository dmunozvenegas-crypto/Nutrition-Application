Requirement will need to have promises that will be succussed of reject, have try and catch. first try local url with user input to complete url request if promise is rejected then catch that error, if error === 400 then try api url and user input and try to fullfill the promise if  still rejection exit code catch error and console.log here we can see error and handle accordling
